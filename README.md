# WAREHOUSE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (WIMS)

## Overview

WIMS is a custom login system for warehouse operations. WIMS is a web app that allows warehouse staff to get updated on their daily assignments, easily locate items using a map, document and update their product's processing status and gives a clear overview for the warehouse manager to allocate tasks to their staff.




## Data Model
The application will store Users, Inventory Directory, and a mapping/layout of warehouse space


* managers can have access to multiple users
* each staff has a list of tasks (via forms)
* users have access to inventory directory and warehouse map 
* each list can have multiple items (by embedding)
* users can have multiple lists (via references)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "manager",
  password: // a login password hash,
  staff: // an array of references to staff lists
}
{
  username: "staff",
  password: // a login password hash,
  tasks: // an array of tasks
}
{
  product id: // string
  status: // an array of status options(ie. raw, processing, processed, ready to ship, shipped, collected payment)
  task: [
    { name: "mike", time: "9:20", task: 'spraypaint black', completed: false},
    { name: "alice", time: "9:20", task: 'installed handle', completed: false},
    { name: "bob", time: "10:00", task: 'boxed and labeled package', completed: true},
  ] // name of person , time started on product, details of task, completed status
}
```
